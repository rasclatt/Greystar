>Built from the ground up for Network Marketing
>The Best of Custom Programming and 3rd Party Architecture
>
>The Unity software solution is a Web based application which uses the best of custom programming and the best of third party architecture to combine to create a solution that works for the small company and scales to the largest of companies.
>
>Because Unity was built from the ground up as a data-driven web application, our team of developers can get your company up and running with your compensation plan faster than our competitors can give you a cost estimate. In fact, if you are in the market for sophisticated MLM software, you should request a demo of our software using live test data and your own comp plan!
>
>In today's economy, home-based network marketing companies are in high-growth mode. The sagging U.S. economy is causing an increasing number of Americans to turn towards non-traditional sources of revenue, including their own home-based business. People now operate in a networked economy where their teams, clients, and competitors can span the globe. For select companies, this brings enormous opportunity. But those that cannot adapt will get left behind.
>
>Greystar makes it possible for companies to launch international programs with independent distributors around the world at a fraction of the cost of its less agile competitors.
>
>Unity's reporting for sales, commissions, and genealogies is real time for the entire company as well as each distributor. Head and shoulders above its traditional competitors, Unity's real-time, web-based solution is the new standard in MLM software!
